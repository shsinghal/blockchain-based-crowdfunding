# blockchain-based-crowdfunding
secure and safer form of crowdfunding using blockchain

Problem Statement:
An online platform which provides a better and secure path towards crowdfunding.

Abstract:
The project uses blockchain policy for preventing piracy and uses ethereum smart contract to construct a mechanism which uses an automatic way to handle crowdfunding without pear to pear interaction of donor and acceptor

The project includes two main objectives:
It distributes decision making power to crowd funders(Investors) rather than just giving entire power to the owner of the project.
 More decision taken by voting makes the project more successful and also increases the trust of funder(Investors) towards it

smart contract has set guidelines which state date of completion of project (divided into phases) and each phase has proper fund(in form of ether) to be allotted  which will automatically be transmitted to account of owner of the project on completion of project phase or else refunded back  to funder account in case of any delay in completing the in proper duration.
